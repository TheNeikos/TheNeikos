### Hi there 👋

I'm a programmer from Europe, currently working in OSS using Rust 🦀. 


<!--

I'm proud of the following projects:

  <dd>
    <blockquote>
      Rustbreak is a Daybreak inspired self-contained file database. It is meant to be fast and simple to use. 
      You add it to your application and it should just work for you. The only thing you will have to take care of is saving.

Feel free to send me emails at `neikos at neikos dot email`, but do not write to me for anything cryptocurrency/blockchain related. I will just report it as spam (which it is).
